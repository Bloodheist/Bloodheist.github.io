# Human

*As a mortal subject of the Undying Empire you are one of a hardy breed, accustomed to gnawing hunger, tireless labour, and casual brutality. Some of your companions pray for immortality, but many hope only to survive another day. You mingle nightly with monsters many times stronger than you, and treat vampires as you might a speaking tiger: horrifying marvels whose whims and appetites must be appeased.*

## Special Rules

### Easy Prey 
You cannot fight a Vampire or other Monstrosity in single combat. You must run from them, hide from them, or use an Inimical Object or Ritual to repel them. 

### Unhindered 
You are not subject to the supernatural restrictions that afflict vampires. You can walk in sunlight, cross running water, enter buildings uninvited, and so on and so forth.
