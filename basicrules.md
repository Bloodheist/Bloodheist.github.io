## Basic Rules

Player characters in Bloodheist are skilled Thieves, hired for dangerous jobs that nobody else will take. Thieves are defined by a few simple terms, which should be noted on your Criminal Record sheet.  

**Skills** - What you do better than anyone else. You start with four Skills, and may learn up to twelve.  

**Tools** - Useful possessions. You start with four Tools, and may carry up to twelve.  

**Doom** - A measurement of how close your Thief is to their Awful End. This is expressed as a Doom Score that can range from zero to six. The higher this number, the more Doom Dice you must roll (see below).  

**Rituals** - Ancient, sinister magics. Each Ritual that your Thief has learned raises their Minimum Doom Score by one point.  

**Folly** - Your Folly is a mania that grips your Thief when they feel their Doom closing in around them. 

### Rolling Dice
When a Thief attempts a difficult task where the outcome is uncertain, the Dealer will ask the player to state exactly what their Thief is doing, and what they hope to accomplish. The player will then roll a certain number of d6s in order to determine the outcome.   
#### Base Dice
A player will always roll at least one light-coloured d6, known as a Base Dice, when their Thief attempt a risky or difficult task.    

Players may add extra Base Dice to their roll under the following circumstances:  

* They have a relevant **Skill**.   
* They have a relevant **Tool**.   
* They are **Aided** by another Thief or NPC.   

*Note: The Dealer is the ultimate arbiter of whether a Skill or Tool will grant an extra Base Dice to a roll, but they are encouraged to be generous if the player makes a plausible case.*  

The maximum number of Base Dice that can be used in a single roll is Four.  

*Example: Lady Bloodmist wishes to pick a lock. As standard she rolls one Base Dice. Since she has the Skill Lockpicking and the Tool Lockpicks, she can add two more Base Dice to her roll, for a total of three.*

#### Doom Dice
When a player attempts a risky or difficult task, the Dealer will ask them to add dark-coloured d6s, known as Doom Dice, to the roll. The number of Doom Dice added is Equal to the player’s Current Doom Score.  

Players can be asked to add extra Doom Dice, exceeding their current Doom Score, under the following circumstances:   

* They are casting a **Ritual**.
* They are opposed by a **Powerful Foe**.
* They are a Vampire in the presence of **Inimical Objects**. 
* They are **Upping the Stakes**.  

There is No Limit on how many Doom Dice can be used in a single roll.  

*Example: Lady Bloodmist wishes to leap from one moving train carriage to another. By default she rolls one Base Dice. As she is putting herself at risk, and her Doom Score is one, the Dealer asks her to add one Doom Dice to her roll, for a total of two dice.*
 
### Success 
The outcome of the roll is determined by the highest single die of Either Type.  

* 1 is a **Catastrophe**. The outcome is the opposite to what the Thief wanted.  
* 2-3 is a **Failure**. Things get worse for the Thief.
* 4-5 is a **Mixed Success**. The Thief gets what they wanted, but with a cost or consequence.  
* 6 is a **Full Success**. The Thief gets what they wanted. If multiple sixes were rolled, the Dealer may allow them some additional unforeseen benefit.  

**Upping the Stakes:** Players may elect to re-roll all their dice if they are not happy with their level of success. However, the player must add an extra Doom Dice to this re-roll.  

*Note: As both Base and Doom Dice count towards successes, it is beneficial for Thieves to introduce more risk into their plans. This is deliberate, as it means exciting and dangerous actions are more likely to succeed in the short term, encouraging reckless play.*

### Doom 
If the result of the highest Doom Die exceeds the result of the highest Base Die, and exceeds the player’s current Doom Score, then the player must increase their Doom Score by one point. 

*Example: Leaping between train carriages, Lady Bloodmist rolls a 2 on her Base Dice and a 6 on her Doom Dice. Her highest roll was a 6, so she gets a Full Success. However, her Doom Dice rolled higher than her Base Dice and her current Doom Score of one. Lady Bloodmist successfully leaps between the carriages, but must increase her Doom Score to two.*  

As a player’s Doom Score increases, new rules that govern their Thief’s actions will come into effect.

### Follies 
When their Doom Score reaches Three, a player must roll on the Follies table (p.24) to find out how their Thief reacts to the creeping sense of Doom. Once a Folly is in play, it can only be neutralised by lowering a Thief’s Doom Score below three. 

### Sabotage 
When their Doom Score reaches Five, a player can try to Sabotage other Thieves, to shift the burden of their dark fate to their companions. The player must declare sabotage, and then roll a single Doom Dice. If the result is Lower than their current Doom Score, the sabotaging player is successful, and may lower their Doom by one. If the result is Higher, their sabotage fails, and their Doom Score rises by one point.  

After a player has sabotaged once, they may continue to do so when their Doom Score is below five.
Once a player’s Doom Score reaches Six, sabotage cannot save them from their Awful End.  

*Example: Lady Bloodmist has reached a Doom Score of five. She decides to sabotage her fellow Thief, John Sandpiper, by cutting the rope he’s climbing up. She rolls a 2 on her Doom Dice, lower than her Doom Score. Lady Bloodmist successfully sabotages John and he falls  into a moat full of hungry wolf-eels! She lowers her Doom Score to four.* 

### Awful Ends
When a player’s Doom Score reaches Six, their Awful End is upon them. The Dealer will decide how they meet their fate. Sometimes this will be obvious: if a player is locked in combat with a vampire prince, they will meet their Awful End at his hands. However, the Dealer may also roll on the Grand Dooms table (p.38) and see what chance has in store for the luckless Thief.  

*Example: Looking to get even, John Sandpiper attempts to sabotage Lady Bloodmist’s escape by shooting out the tyres of her getaway car. He rolls a 6 on his Doom Dice, higher than his Doom Score of five. His sabotage attempt fails, and John’s Doom Score reaches six. His Awful End is at hand! Chuckling, the Dealer rolls on the Grand Dooms table.*  

*Note: Thieves don’t have Hit Points. Doom is the only measure of how close they are to their Awful End. However, Doom doesn’t only represent physical injuries, and reaching six Doom isn’t an instant death sentence - the Dealer simply has permission to end that Thief’s story whenever it would be most dramatic*.

### Conflict with NPCs
Non-Player Characters do not roll dice, do not have Skills and Tools, and do not have a Doom Score. In general the Dealer should see them as extras in a film; the players are the stars.   

There are no separate rules for combat. Thieves who wish to fight, persuade, impede, or otherwise humiliate a NPC should assemble their dice pool in the manner previously described, and the Dealer will narrate the outcome of the conflict depending on the degree of success rolled. NPCs normally take one Full Success or two Mixed Successes to defeat in armed combat.   

Powerful vampires or rare monsters could require two, three, or even four Full Successes to be defeated. These NPCs will be designated with the tag **Powerful Foe**. Players must roll an extra Doom Dice when dealing with these opponents.

### Opposed Rolls 
Sometimes the players may wish to act against one another in a way the sabotage rules do not seem appropriate for. In such cases, both players should build their dice pools and roll simultaneously. Whoever has the Highest Single Dice dictates the narrative outcome. If both players have a matching highest dice, they must either negotiate a compromise or roll again. Player’s Doom Scores can increase as normal during opposed rolls.  

*Example: John Sandpiper and Lady Bloodmist are competing in a dancing competition. John has no relevant Tools or Skills, so he rolls one Base Dice and Doom Dice equal to his Doom Score. Lady Bloodmist has the Skill ‘Fancy Footwork’, so she rolls two Base Dice and Doom Dice equal to her Doom Score. Lady Bloodmist rolls a six, higher than any of John’s dice. She wins the dance-off.* 

### The Dice of Fate
In general, the twists and turns of a Bloodheist game will be determined by the players’ rolls. The Dealer is not required to roll dice. However, sometimes players will ask a question that hinges on chance rather than their own actions: ‘Is there a taxi available on this quiet street?’ ‘Is there some wood in the cellar that I could set ablaze?’ ‘Is it going to rain soon?’  

In such cases, the Dealer may defer to the Dice of Fate. The Dealer rolls one d6 and allow it to guide the outcome. Results of Four or Higher give an answer that favours the Thieves, and results of Three or Less give a negative answer or bad outcome.  

*Note: If you find yourself in a situation where the rules don’t seem to cover what’s happening, the Dealer should make a quick ruling that seems reasonable and move on with the narrative. After the game session, you can return to the rules dilemma as a group and discuss what should be done in future.*

## Advancement
Bloodheist is designed for single-session play, in which a group of unlikely Thieves assemble and either make off with the Prize or die trying. However, if you wish to play a multi-session campaign in which the players grow stronger and more capable with each successful heist, use the following rules. 

### Earning Experience Points
**Experience Points** (XP) are an abstraction, representing the wealth Thieves earn from their criminal acts, as well as the greater confidence and sophistication they gain in the field of criminal enterprises. Players earn XP for completing certain tasks or milestones during the session:  

* One XP for escaping the location with the Prize.
* One XP for delivering the Prize to your Patron.
* One XP if you have carried out a task imposed on you by your Secret.  

*Note: Not all of these conditions can or will be fulfilled. You should avoid granting XP for the use of Secrets that already grant a boon or extra power to the player, instead reserving it for the Secrets that compel a player to carry out an actual mission.* 

### Spending Experience Points
Players can spend accumulated XP on Thief upgrades or benefits. XP must be spent between heists; it cannot be used during a heist. Each listed benefit costs one point:  

* 	Learn a new Skill.
* 	Aquire a new Tool.
* 	Learn a new Ritual.
* 	Forget an unwanted Ritual.
* 	Reduce your Doom Score by one point.  

Tools earned using this method can be anything the player desires, so long as they are plausible within the setting. New Skills should ideally relate to something the Thief attempted during their previous heist.  
 
*Example: Lady Bloodmist commandeered an automobile during the heist, despite not having a relevant Skill. Once the heist is over, she can spend one XP to gain Driving as a permanent Skill.*

### Forgetting Skills
If a player did not use a Skill during the heist, they must mark the unsued Skill with an X. If a Skill marked in this way goes unused during a second heist, it must be erased from the player’s Criminal Record. 

### Learning and Mastering Rituals
Rituals learned can come from the existing list; alternatively, the player can pitch an idea for a new Ritual to the Dealer, who is the ultimate arbiter of whether such an act of dark magic would be possible.  
 
Additionally, a Thief may spend two XP in order to **Master** a Ritual they have already learned. Rituals that have been Mastered no longer raise the Thief’s minimum Doom Score by one point, although using them still requires an extra Doom Dice to be added to the roll. A Thief cannot Master more than three Rituals.

### Post-Heist Doom
After a heist, players may reduce their Thief’s Doom Score by two points, unless this would take them below their minimum Doom Score. Any Follies gained during the Heist remain active. Players may spend XP to further reduce the Thief’s Doom Score - this is assumed to represent the wild debauchery Thieves indulge in between jobs, to blot out their creeping sense of dread. 

### Becoming a Vampire
Many humans in the Undying Empire crave the gift of immortality. If a human Thief is granted the boon of vampirism, either by another player’s Thief or by a vampire NPC, simply erase the  special rules pertaining to humans from their character sheet and replace them with the special rules pertaining to vampires. No other alterations are necessary, although the player may wish to roll on the Vampiric Marks table to discover how their Thief’s body changes.
